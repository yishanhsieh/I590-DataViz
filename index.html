        The World Happiness Report published the world happiness country
        rankings every year since 2002, and north European Countries, like
        Finland and Denmark have been ranked the highest for several years.
        
        Explore the scatter plot of world happiness and Log GDP, you'll find a trend showing that the happier 
        countries seem to be well-developed and have higher GDP,
        but does that mean the higher GDP a country has, the happier their
        people are?

          Life Ladder, or Cantril Ladder, is an numerical indicator used in the
          World Happiness report to evaluate country happiness rankings. The
          score was collected by asking respondents to evaluate their current
          life as a whole using the image of a ladder, with the best possible
          life for them as a 10 and worst possible as a 0. (Helliwell et al.,
          2023)
        </li>
        <li>
          The GDP level is categorized based on the distribution of Log GDP Per
          Capita of a country from 2005 to 2021. If the Log GDP Per Capita of a
          country is higher than 75%, it’s a high GDP level. If it’s between 50%
          to 75%, it’s a higher-middle GDP level. If it’s between 25% to 50%,
          it’s a lower-middle GDP level. If it’s below 25%, it’s a low GDP
          level.

        Whether money brings happiness is still in a debate. While some studies
        agree with the assumption, some research indicates that richer people
        are more likely to suffer from mental health issues. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Let’s look at the
        worldwide mental disorders diagnosis percentage from 2006 to 2017,
        including 
        <span class='tooltip'>Schizophrenia<span class="tooltiptext">
          Affects how people think, feel and behave, may result in a mix of hallucinations and delusions.</span>
          </span>, 
        <span class='tooltip'>Bipolar disorders<span class='tooltiptext'>
          Causes unusual shifts in a person’s mood, energy, activity levels, and concentration.</span>

        <span class='tooltip'>Eating disorders<span class='tooltiptext'>
          Have an unhealthy relationship with food, like anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder.</span>

          Frequently have intense, excessive and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations.</span>,

          Hard to stop or control alcohol use despite adverse social, occupational, or health consequences.</span>

  <br/>Since there is only one country’s data available in 2005, we removed the data in 2005 and start from 2006.

      The boxplots revealed a stable distribution of worldwide mental disorders from 2006 to 2017. The annual max, min, and median of each disorder are similar. For Schizophrenia and Eating disorders, there is a trend showing that high GDP level countries have higher diagnosis percentages while low GDP level countries have lower percentages. However, for other disorders, like Depression or Alcohol use disorders, the distribution is more random, and there is no obvious pattern showing the relationship between GDP level and the mental disorder rate.

      <p>You may be surprised that those high GDP countries listed as happiest countries have high mental disorders diagnosis percentage. For example, Sweden has a relatively high bipolar disorders percentage, but Morocco, as a lower-middle GDP country, has high depression percentage.</p> 
      <br />
      <p>We can take a deeper look at this tricky fact by comparing two countries at extreme. Luxemburg had highest log GDP per capita in 2017 and had much higher Life Ladder score (7.06) than Venezuela (5.07), which had the lowest log GDP per capita in that year. However, Luxemburg had significantly higher anxiety disorder rate than Venezuela (5.31%) than Venezuela(2.86%).</p>

        On the other hand, Greece(10.26) has a significantly higher GDP per capita compared to Uzbekistan(8.83) in 2017, but Uzbekistan's(6.42) happiness score is higher than Greece's(5.14), and anxiety disorder prevalence is much higher in Greece(5.79%) compared to Uzbekistan(2.56%).

    <section>
    <p>The comparison reinforces the idea that economic wealth, as represented by GDP, is not the sole determinant of happiness or mental health outcomes. Countries like Uzbekistan, despite lower GDP, may have stronger societal or cultural factors contributing to higher happiness and lower anxiety. This highlights the need to focus on well-being metrics beyond GDP.</p>

        From the above observations, it seems that some high GDP countries have higher mental disorders, especially higher anxiety and depression, but there are also exceptions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let’s find statistical evidence by exploring the correlation between GDP and seven mental disorders.
      </p>
      <img src="./assets/heatmap-correlation.png"/>
      <p>
        From the heatmap, we found that GDP has a strong correlation with Life Ladder (correlation = 0.8).
        Mental health disorders exhibit varied relationships with well-being and economic indicators, with Eating disorders(correlation = 0.8) having the most prominent correlations.
        Alcohol use disorder(correlation = 0.2) and Depression (correlation = 0.1) have the weakest correlations across the board, indicating they might be influenced by more localized or specific factors beyond economic and health metrics.

        Venezuela's sharp GDP drop in 2017 was driven by a combination of factors, primarily its worsening economic crisis. A significant decline in oil prices, the country's main revenue source, and collapsing foreign exchange reserves severely impacted its economy. The government's refusal to adjust economic policies, including price controls and currency restrictions, worsened the situation. Additionally, the country faced hyperinflation due to excessive money printing, leading to a dramatic fall in GDP by 16%. The collapse of domestic industries and massive emigration further deepened the crisis

        In the U.S., drug use disorders increased from 2.97 (2008) to 3.45 (2017), reflecting the impact of the opioid epidemic, which worsened after 2014. Economic struggles following the 2008 financial crisis likely contributed, as did increased awareness and reporting of addiction. The opioid crisis, with rising deaths from opioids and fentanyl, played a key role in this trend, alongside expanded treatment programs and public health efforts to address the epidemic.

      Conclusion
    
    </section>

    
    <section id="method">
      <h2>Data source</h2>
        <p>We used two datasets from Kaggle. One is <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usamabuttar/world-happiness-report-2005-present" target="_blank">World Happiness Report, 2005-Present</a> uploaded by Usama Buttar compiled from World Happiness Report. The variables include six happiness variables (GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption) and life ladder score. The other dataset is <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-mental-health-disorders" target="_blank">Global Mental Health Disorder, 2005-2017</a>, was first compiled by Amit from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health#all-charts-preview" target="_blank">Our World in Data-Mental health</a>. The dataset contains the prevalence of seven common mental health disorders from various countries around the world. 
          </p>
      <h2>Method</h2>
      <h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
        <p>First, we removed null value in both datasets. The World Happiness dataset initially has 2199 rows and has 1683 rows left. The Mental Disorder dataset initially has 108,553 rows and has 5,488 rows left. Second, we rename the column names in a camel case style, like ‘year’ to ‘Year’, and synchronize the column refers country name into ‘Country Name’ for both datasets. We also remove the % symbol in the mental disorder column names to ensure simplicity. Additionally, we adjusted the mental disorder percentage, which are numerical values from object into float 64, and converted the data type of column ‘year’  into ‘int64’. After the basic cleaning, we joined the two datasets by inner join on columns ‘country name’ and ‘year’.  The final joined dataset keeps the data from 2005 to 2017, with 1221 entries in total.</p>
