        The World Happiness Report has published the world happiness country rankings every year since 2002, and northern European Countries, like Finland and Denmark, have been ranked the highest for several years. Explore the scatter plot of world happiness and Log GDP. There is a trend showing that the happier countries seem to be well-developed and have higher GDP, but does that mean the higher a country's GDP, the happier its people are?

      Notes:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Life Ladder, or Cantril Ladder, is a numerical indicator used in the World Happiness Report to evaluate country happiness rankings. The score was collected by asking respondents to evaluate their current life as a whole using the image of a ladder, with the best possible life for them as a 10 and the worst possible as a 0. (Helliwell et al., 2023)
        </li>
        <li>
          The GDP level is categorized based on the distribution of the Log GDP Per Capita of a country from 2005 to 2021. If the Log GDP Per Capita of a country is higher than 75%, it’s a high GDP level. If it’s between 50% to 75%, it’s a higher-middle GDP level. If it’s between 25% to 50%, it’s a lower-middle GDP level. If it’s below 25%, it’s a low GDP level.

      <h2>Trend analysis</h2>
      <p>
        Whether money brings happiness is still under debate. While some studies agree with the assumption, some research indicates that richer people are more likely to suffer from mental health issues. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Let’s look at the
        worldwide mental disorders diagnosis percentage from 2006 to 2017,
        including 
        <span class='tooltip'>Schizophrenia<span class="tooltiptext">
          Affects how people think, feel and behave, may result in a mix of hallucinations and delusions.</span>
          </span>, 
        <span class='tooltip'>Bipolar disorders<span class='tooltiptext'>
          Causes unusual shifts in a person’s mood, energy, activity levels, and concentration.</span>
          </span>, 
        <span class='tooltip'>Eating disorders<span class='tooltiptext'>
          Have an unhealthy relationship with food, like anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder.</span>
          </span>, 
        <span class='tooltip'>Anxiety disorders<span class='tooltiptext'>
          Frequently have intense, excessive and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations.</span>, 
          </span>
        <span class='tooltip'>Drug use disorders<span class='tooltiptext'>
          Have a problematic pattern of substance use that affects health and quality of life.</span>
          </span>,
        <span class='tooltip'>Depression<span class="tooltiptext">
          Involves a depressed mood or loss of pleasure or interest in activities for long periods of time.</span>
          </span>, and
        <span class='tooltip'>Alcohol use disorders<span class='tooltiptext'>
          Hard to stop or control alcohol use despite adverse social, occupational, or health consequences.</span>
          </span>
      . Select the dropdown menu to switch different disorders.

      Notes:<br/>Since there is only one country’s data available in 2005, we removed the data in 2005 and start from 2006.
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>
        The scattered boxplots revealed a stable distribution of worldwide mental disorders from 2006 to 2017. The annual max, min, and median of each disorder are similar. For Schizophrenia and Eating disorders, there is a trend showing that high GDP level countries have higher diagnosis percentages while low GDP level countries have lower percentages. However, for other disorders, like Depression or Alcohol use disorders, the distribution is more random, and there is no obvious pattern showing the relationship between GDP level and the mental disorder rate.
      </p>
       <br/>
      <p>Let’s take a closer look at the country’s level. The choropleth map shows the average diagnosis rate from 2006 to 2017. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You may be surprised that those high GDP countries listed as happiest countries have a high mental disorders diagnosis percentage. For example, Sweden has a relatively high bipolar disorder percentage, but Morocco, as a lower-middle GDP country, has a high depression percentage.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Country Comparison</h2>
      <p>We can take a deeper look at this tricky fact by comparing two countries at the extreme. Luxemburg had the highest log GDP per capita in 2017 and had a much higher Life Ladder score (7.06) than Venezuela (5.07), which had the lowest log GDP per capita in that year. However, Luxemburg had a significantly higher anxiety disorder rate than Venezuela (5.31%) than Venezuela (2.86%).</section>

      frameborder="0"
    ></iframe>

    <section>
     
      <p>
        On the other hand, Greece(10.26) has a significantly higher GDP per capita compared to Uzbekistan(8.83) in 2017, but Uzbekistan's(6.42) happiness score is higher than Greece's(5.14), and anxiety disorder prevalence is much higher in Greece(5.79%) compared to Uzbekistan(2.56%).
      </p> 
    </section>

    <iframe

      frameborder="0"
    ></iframe>
    
    <section>
      <p>The comparison reinforces the idea that economic wealth, as represented by GDP, is not the sole determinant of happiness or mental health outcomes. Countries like Uzbekistan, despite lower GDP, may have stronger societal or cultural factors contributing to higher happiness and lower anxiety. This highlights the need to focus on well-being metrics beyond GDP.</p>

    </section>   

    <section>
      <h2>Correlation</h2>
      <p>From the above observations, it seems that some high GDP countries have higher mental disorders, especially higher anxiety and depression, but there are also exceptions.</p>
        </br>
      <p>Let’s find statistical evidence by exploring the correlation between GDP and seven mental disorders.</p>
    </section>
  
    <div class='img-container'>
      <img style="width:800px" src="./assets/heatmap-correlation.png"/>
    </div>

    <section>
      <p>From the heatmap, we found that GDP has a strong correlation with Life Ladder (correlation = 0.8). Mental health disorders exhibit varied relationships with well-being and economic indicators, with Eating disorders(correlation = 0.8) having the most prominent correlations. Alcohol use disorder(correlation = 0.2) and Depression (correlation = 0.1) have the weakest correlations across the board, indicating they might be influenced by more localized or specific factors beyond economic and health metrics. The result aligns with our observation from the scattered boxplot.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Influence beyond GDP</h2>
      <p>To investigate some possible reasons that lead to a country’s mental disorder changes, we created an interactive scatter plot. The interactive scatter plot was made by Plotly Dash, and you can find the code on our <a href="https://github.com/yishanhsieh/I590-DataViz/blob/main/md_correlation_dash.ipynb" target="_blank">github</a> and run it on your local machine.</p>
        <br />
      <p>Let’s look at Venezuela’s Depression rate in 2008 and 2017.</p>
    </section>
  
    <img src="./assets/depression_combined.png"/>
    
    <section>
      <p>Venezuela’s Depression rate slightly increased in 2017, from 2.7% to 2.8%; however, the GDP declined dramatically in 2017.  It seems the economic drop didn’t increase the depression rate. The observation also aligned with the low relationship between GDP and depression shown in the heatmap.</p>
       <br />
      <p>Venezuela's sharp GDP drop in 2017 was driven by a combination of factors, primarily its worsening economic crisis. A significant decline in oil prices, the country's main revenue source, and collapsing foreign exchange reserves severely impacted its economy. The government's refusal to adjust economic policies, including price controls and currency restrictions, worsened the situation. Additionally, the country faced hyperinflation due to excessive money printing, leading to a dramatic fall in GDP of 16%. The collapse of domestic industries and massive emigration further deepened the crisis. In our future work, we’d like to find other datasets to find the hidden factors that drive depression.</p>
        <br />
      <p>Another case is the drug use disorders in the North America, especially the United States.</p>  
    </section>

    <img src="./assets/drug_combined_transparent.png"/>
 
    <section>
      <p>In the U.S., drug use disorders increased from 2.97 (2008) to 3.45 (2017), reflecting the impact of the opioid epidemic, which worsened after 2014. Economic struggles following the 2008 financial crisis likely contributed, as did increased awareness and reporting of addiction. The opioid crisis, with rising deaths from opioids and fentanyl, played a key role in this trend, alongside expanded treatment programs and public health efforts to address the epidemic.</p> 
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Conculsion</h2>
      <p>Here are the insights we learned from the analysis:</p>
    
      <ul>
        <li>Countries ranked top in the World Happiness Ranking don’t necessarily have lower mental disorders. The ranking only relies on the Life Ladder score, but there are more complicated factors that lead to good mental health.</li>
        <li>Countries ranked top in the World Happiness Ranking tend to have higher GDP (correlation = 0.8), but also tend to have higher eating disorders (correlation = 0.8) and schizophrenia (correlation=0.72), but little to do with depression and alcohol use disorders.</li>
        <li>The worldwide mental disorder trend from 2006 to 2017 had been stable regardless of the GDP changes. Therefore, despite GDP, there may be stronger societal or cultural factors contributing to mental disorders. This highlights the need to focus on well-being metrics beyond GDP.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <h2>Data source</h2>
        <p>We used two datasets from Kaggle. One is <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usamabuttar/world-happiness-report-2005-present" target="_blank">World Happiness Report, 2005-Present</a> uploaded by Usama Buttar compiled from World Happiness Report. The variables include six happiness variables (GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption) and life ladder score. The other dataset is <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-mental-health-disorders" target="_blank">Global Mental Health Disorder, 2005-2017</a>, was first compiled by Amit from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health#all-charts-preview" target="_blank">Our World in Data-Mental health</a>. The dataset contains the prevalence of seven common mental health disorders from various countries around the world. 
          </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Method</h2>
      <h3>Data cleaning</h3>
        <p>First, we removed null value in both datasets. The World Happiness dataset initially has 2199 rows and has 1683 rows left. The Mental Disorder dataset initially has 108,553 rows and has 5,488 rows left. Second, we rename the column names in a camel case style, like ‘year’ to ‘Year’, and synchronize the column refers country name into ‘Country Name’ for both datasets. We also remove the % symbol in the mental disorder column names to ensure simplicity. Additionally, we adjusted the mental disorder percentage, which are numerical values from object into float 64, and converted the data type of column ‘year’  into ‘int64’. After the basic cleaning, we joined the two datasets by inner join on columns ‘country name’ and ‘year’.  The final joined dataset keeps the data from 2005 to 2017, with 1221 entries in total.</p>
      <br />
      <h3>Data analysis</h3>
        <p>We adopted descriptive analysis and correlation analysis. At the EDA phase, we created scattered boxplots, correlation charts and line charts to explore patterns and trends in the two datasets. However, the two datasets include more than twenty variables that may have hidden complicated causation or correlation. To narrow down the research scope, we decided to focus on the GDP, the life ladder, and the seven mental disorders.</p>
      <br />
      <h3>Data visualization</h3>
        <p>Before we proceed into visualization, we created a data story wireframe on Figjam. In the final work, we used Matplotlib, Plotly and Dash framework to create the visualization.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Scatter plot</b>: show the trend of the life ladder and GDP levels distribution</li>
          <li><b>Scattered boxplot</b>: display the worldwide mental disorders trend (boxplot) and provide country-level details (dots).</li>
          <li><b>Choropleth</b>: give a whole picture of the worldwide average diagnosis rate by equirectangular projection. We selected this projection because it can show entire vertical and horizontal angle of view without causing too much land distortion, so our users can clearly identify the mental disorder value of each country.</li>
          <li><b>Bar chart</b>: a side-by-side bar chart for country comparison. We provide the code that allows users to compare any two countries’ mental disorder rate, GDP and the life ladder in a selected year.</li>
          <li><b>Heatmap</b>: show the correlation between mental disorders, GDP, and the life ladder</li>
          <li><b>Scatter plot (Dash)</b>: Dash framework supports advanced filtering with simpler code. We used Dash to create an interactive scatter plot that shows the mental disorder changes by years.</li>
        </ul>
      <br />
      <h3>Limitation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The joined dataset for the GDP and mental disorder analysis covers the years 2005 to 2017, so the results cannot be extrapolated to other time periods.</li>
          <li>The definition of happiness in this report is limited to seven mental disorders, so the results may not be applicable to scenarios where happiness is defined by additional dimensions.</li>
        </ul>
